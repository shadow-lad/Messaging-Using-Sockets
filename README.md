## [Java Backend](Java%20Backend/README.md)

This project uses Java to create a backend application to handle messages and requests to and from clients. It is a basic implementation of a messaging server and has no security. It uses JSON to communicated with the server

A detailed explanation of how the client communicates with the server is given [here](FORMAT.md).
